This module performs augmentation for the images with respect to it's environment. 

Conditions like fog and rain control the visibility of the image to a great extent. Road augmentation techniques involve the addition of gravel, presence of manholes,
speed of the object, shadows casted by the object etc. With respect to weather, there are a lot of other parameters to consider like different seasons: autumn, spring, 
snow, and multiple brightness levels like full bright, partial sunflare and night time. These are some of the augmentation scenarios considered while performing 
environmental augmentations for this research project. The intensity of each parameter can be fine-tuned manually; an automated tuning has also also built into this project.

For each augmentation type, a skeleton of steps are followed. First, the region of interest (classifcation object) is identified, then depending upon the requirement 
of the augmentation, the HSB (hue, saturation and brightness) and RGB (red,blue, green) parameters are modified on the region of interest (ROI) or around the ROI. 
For example, to augment the season of autumn, the object must be identified and then from the surrounding (outside ROI) other prominent objects are considered to 
perfrom ‘225’ R scale value in RGB. The build is capable of applying random augmentation techniques to the training set.

Enjoy augmenting the images with subject to it's nature!!!
